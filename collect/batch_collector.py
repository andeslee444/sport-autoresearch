"""Batch NBA player data collector.

Searches all NBA players, filters by minutes played, and collects
game logs + profile data for qualifying players. Supports incremental
mode (skip recent files) and dry-run (roster preview only).

Usage:
    python3 -m collect.batch_collector --min-minutes 20 --max-players 60 --sport nba --dry-run
    python3 -m collect.batch_collector --min-minutes 20 --max-players 60
    python3 -m collect.batch_collector --force  # ignore cached files
